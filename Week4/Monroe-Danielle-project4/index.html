		<h2 id="lamborghini"> Lamborghini Aventador</h2>
		
	
		<p>
				The Lamborghini Aventador is a two-door, two-seater sports car publicly
				introduced by Lamborghini at the Geneva Motor Show on 28 February 2011,
				five months after its initial unveiling in Sant'Agata Bolognese.[2]
				Internally codenamed LB834,[3] the Aventador was designed to replace the
				ten-year-old Murciélago as the new flagship model in the Lamborghini
				lineup starting in 2011.[4] Soon after the Aventador unveiling,
				Lamborghini announced that it had already sold over 12 months of the
				production vehicles, with deliveries starting in the second half of
				2011.[5]</p>
		
		<h2 id="audi"> Audi R8</h2>
			<p>The Audi R8[5] (Typ 42)[7] is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car,[5][8]
			which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive
			system.[5][9] It was introduced by the German automaker Audi AG in 2006.

			The car was exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi
			AG's high performance private subsidiary company, quattro GmbH, and is
			base to the Lamborghini Gallardo platform.[10] The fundamental
			construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame,[5] and uses an
			aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car
			is built by quattro GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's
			'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany.[5]

			In 2005, Audi announced that the name of the successful Audi R8 race car
			would be used for a new road car in 2007, the Audi R8, based on the Audi
			Le Mans quattro concept car (designed by Frank Lamberty and Julian
			Hoenig), appearing at the 2003 International Geneva Motor Show, and 2003
			Frankfurt International Motor Show. The R8 development program began in
			2004, Lamberty's design being approved and frozen for production.
			Production body prototypes began field testing in January 2006. The R8
			road car was officially launched at the Paris Auto Show on 30 September
			2006. There was some confusion with the name, which the car shares with
			the 24 Hours of Le Mans winning R8 Le Mans Prototype (LMP). 6-time 24
			Hours of Le Mans winner Jacky Ickx described the R8 as "the best
			handling road car today".</p>
		
		
			
		<h2 id="ford"> Ford Fiesta</h2>
			<p>
			The Ford Fiesta is a supermini car manufactured by the Ford Motor
			Company since 1976, now in its sixth generation. The Fiesta has been
			manufactured in Europe, the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela,
			China, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Africa.

			In 2010, the sixth generation Fiesta (Mark VI)[1] was introduced
			worldwide, making it the first Fiesta model to be sold in North America
			since the Fiesta Mark I was discontinued at the end of 1980.

			The Fiesta has sold over 16 million units since 1976,[2][3][4] making it
			the third best selling Ford marque behind the Escort and the F-series.
			
			
			 With its driver Ken Block and suped up mechanics, this For Fiesta really
			<strong> moves!! </strong> Ken Block is a rally car driver
			who works and is sponsored by both Monster and DC. He is
			also my son's favorite driver!!</p>
